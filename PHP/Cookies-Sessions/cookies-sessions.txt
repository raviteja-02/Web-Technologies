Sessions and cookies are used to maintain state between requests. Sessions are server-side storage mechanisms that allow you to store data that is specific to a user across multiple requests. Cookies are client-side storage mechanisms that allow you to store data that is specific to a user on their computer.

To handle sessions in PHP, you can use the `session_start()` function to start a new session or resume an existing one. Once a session has been started, you can store data in the session using the `$_SESSION` superglobal array.

To handle cookies in PHP, you can use the `setcookie()` function to set a cookie with a name, value, and expiration time. You can then retrieve the value of the cookie using the `$_COOKIE` superglobal array.
