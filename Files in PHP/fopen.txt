$fptr = fopen("filename","mode");
$fptr = fopen("filename","r");
$fptr = fopen("filename","w");
$fptr = fopen("filename","a");
$fptr = fopen("filename","r+");

fopen returns a file pointer we store it in a variable
after performing the operations we need to close the file using fclose(file pointer);
