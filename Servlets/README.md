# Introduction to Servlets

Servlets are Java-based server-side programs that extend the functionality of web servers to generate dynamic content and handle HTTP requests and responses. In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics related to Servlets:

## Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

Servlets are an advancement of the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) technology, which allows web servers to communicate with external programs to generate dynamic content. Servlets offer better performance and scalability compared to traditional CGI scripts.

## Life Cycle of a Servlet

Servlets have a well-defined life cycle with several methods that are invoked at different stages. The main life cycle methods are:

1. `init()`: Called when the servlet is initialized. It's executed only once during the servlet's lifetime.
2. `service()`: Called for each HTTP request and response cycle. It determines the type of request (GET, POST, etc.) and calls the appropriate method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc.).
3. `destroy()`: Called when the servlet is about to be removed from the server or during server shutdown. It allows cleanup tasks to be performed.

## Deploying a Servlet

To deploy a servlet, you need to package it as a `.war` (Web Application Archive) file and deploy it on a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). The servlet container manages the life cycle of servlets and handles incoming HTTP requests.

## The Servlet API

The Servlet API provides a set of classes and interfaces that servlets use to interact with the servlet container. Some commonly used classes and interfaces are `HttpServlet`, `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, etc.

## Reading Servlet Parameters

Servlets can read parameters sent in the HTTP request, either as query parameters (for GET requests) or as form data (for POST requests). Parameters can be read using the `HttpServletRequest` object.

## Reading Initialization Parameters

Servlets can also have initialization parameters specified in the web application's deployment descriptor (`web.xml`). These parameters are configured during servlet initialization and can be read using the `ServletConfig` object.

## Handling HTTP Requests & Responses

Servlets handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses. They can read request data, process it, and generate dynamic content in the response. Servlets can set response headers and write content using the `HttpServletResponse` object.

## Using Cookies and Sessions

Servlets can work with cookies to store small pieces of data on the client-side. Additionally, they can manage user sessions to maintain state across multiple HTTP requests using the `HttpSession` object.

## Connecting to a Database using JDBC

Servlets can connect to a database to fetch or update data. The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API allows servlets to interact with relational databases. Servlets can execute SQL queries and handle database results.

This chapter provided an introduction to Servlets, covering their evolution from the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), their life cycle, deployment, and interaction with the Servlet API. Additionally, we explored reading servlet parameters, initialization parameters, handling HTTP requests and responses, using cookies and sessions, and connecting to a database using JDBC.

Servlets play a crucial role in web application development and provide a robust mechanism to generate dynamic content and manage user interactions. Feel free to dive deeper into each topic to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Servlets. Happy coding!
